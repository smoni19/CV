## <a name="AboutMe">About Me</a>
I am an aspiring full-stack developer with a background in programming and quality control. I am looking to work in a dynamic environment where personal growth is encouraged.

I entered the job market in an unrelated area but always found that I had a soft spot for coding.  For example, I often found myself incoroporating code into my previous roles in order to make the roles more efficient and would spend my free time experimenting with Java in Processing or JavaScript, HTML and CSS making websites to display information relevant to a game I'm playing.  Because of these factors, I decided to enrol on the Makers bootcamp.  I believe this was a great decision as it will open doors to a career I can fully enjoy and gain much more fulfilment.

I enjoy programming greatly because solving problems in order to bring an idea to fruition is extremely rewarding.  I find that time flies when I'm engrossed in what I'm trying to accomplish.  There's always a new language or library to master and a new way to realise something.

- Languages
  * I greatly enjoy getting to grips with a new language/tool to solve more problems and you become aware of new things you can achieve.  Aside from that, I think expanding your knowledge is a fantastic thing.
  * I use [Processing](https://processing.org/ "Processing") to make computer art with Java, which can be found on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/sialjac/ "Pinterest page").
  * I feel comfortable using Ruby and JavaScript and associated frameworks that I have used during my time on the Makers bootcamp.
  * <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=smoni19&layout=compact&theme=dark">
- Teamwork
  * I believe that my time at Makers has given me valuable experience working as part of a team (as showcased by our group projects) and as part of a pair (nearly every day was spent pair-programming)
  * During my time at ELeather, myself and other lab staff often had to determine how to achieve the day's/week's goals.
- Eye for detail
  * Programming relies on accuracy.  You are unable to achieve your goals if your code is full of typos or if there are brackets in the wrong place.
  * Having worked in a couple of quality control roles, I believe I have great attention to detail:
    * As a traffic sampler at Royal Mail I was expected to accurately report the amounts of items processed by the mail centre as those figures informed how the mail centre was operating/should operate.
    * As a lab technician at ELeather I prepared and tested samples to very specific standards daily, as well as giving detailed feedback as to how samples had performed.
- Communictation
  * Whilst I was at ELeather, I communicated regularly with other lab staff, managers and R&D colleagues so that everyone knew what needed to be done/what had been completed.
  * Also at ELeather, I was expected to train other lab staff regularly on test methods after I had proved that I could follow test methods to the letter.
  * On the Makers course, I was more often than not pair-programming with someone else.  Clear communication was paramount as to ensure both people understood what the other is trying to achieve

### Makers Academy (Oct '21 - Jan '22)
- Makers is a highly selective 12-week software engineering bootcamp.  In order to get a place, I had to complete pre-course material, score 100 points on Codewars and pass a tech test interview.
- Working with others was a major part of the bootcamp, which I enjoyed greatly as I found bouncing ideas around very motivating and it exposes you to others' views on how to go about approaching things.
- We also used Trello/standups/retros to discuss the progress of our group projects so that everyone was on the same page.
- During my time on the Makers bootcamp, the languages/tools I used were:
  * Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails, Sinatra, Capybara, Rspec)
  * JavaScript (ES6, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Jest)
  * APIs
  * PostgreSQL
  * MongoDB
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Bootstrap
- Makers introduced me to TDD and red-green-refactor.  I value this process greatly as I believe it produces better code in terms of making you think more about your goals as well as providing documentation for other contributors.
- As I made a few web applications, I made use of the MVC design pattern
- To be really effective, I used OOP when demanded
- I approached coding using various principles such as SRP and keeping my code DRY.
