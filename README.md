## Your Name

*A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.*

I enjoy programming greatly because solving problems in order to bring an idea to fruition is extremely rewarding.  I find that time flies when I'm engrossed in what I'm trying to achieve with code.  There's always a new language or library to master and a new way to achieve something.

After realising that University wasn't the direction for me, I entered the job market but always found that I always had a soft spot for coding as I often spent my free time experimenting with Java in Processing or JavaScript, HTML and CSS making websites to display information relevant to a game I'm playing.

## Work Experience
**ELeather** (Dec '19 - Aug '21)  
_QC Laboratory Technician_

- In this role, I worked in a team and solo to prepare samples and test them to international standards and those set by our customers, including Nike.
- I took the initiative to create VBA macros in Excel to make daily data management tasks more efficient for myself and the others in my team as well as those in other departments.
- I was expected to keep up with regularly changing priorities
-	I observed health and safety procedures present in the laboratory and factory

**Royal Mail** (Apr '15 - Dec '18)  
_Traffic Sampler_

- Processed high volumes of data in a speedy and accurate manner
- Collected data either by physically taking counts or inputting characteristics of sampled mail
-	Worked independently, using my own initiative to ensure the team's targets are achieved on a monthly basis
-	Confident in verbal and written communication with many tiers of authority, ground staff to senior managers

**Royal Mail** (Nov '13 - Apr '15)  
_Mail sorter_

- Worked at a fast pace to ensure mail is sorted in a speedy and accurate manner
- Complied with health and safety standards â€“ maintaining a high standard of housekeeping


## Skills

*Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.*
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

- Teamwork
  * I believe that my time at Makers has given me valuable experience working as part of a team (as showcased by our group projects) and as part of a pair (nearly every day was spent pair-programming)
  * During my time at ELeather, myself and other lab staff often had to determine how to achieve the day's/week's goals.
- Eye for detail
  * Programming relies on accuracy.  You are unable to achieve your goals if your code is full of typos or if there are brackets in the wrong place.
  * Having worked in a couple of quality control roles (traffic sampler at Royal Mail and lab technician at ELeather), I believe I have great attention to detail as I was expected to accurately report the amounts of items processed by the mail centre and I prepared and tested samples to very specific standards daily, as well as giving feedback as to how samples had performed.
- Communictation
  * Whilst I was at ELeather, I communicated regularly with other lab staff, managers and R&D colleagues so that everyone knew what needed to be done/what had been completed.
  * Also at ELeather, I was expected to train other lab staff regularly on test methods after I had proved that I could follow test methods to the letter.
  * On the Makers course, I was more often than not pair-programming with someone else.  Clear communication was paramount as to ensure both people understood what the other is trying to achieve

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
- During my time at ELeather, I created and improved multiple macros and spreadsheets to allow colleagues both inside and outside of the lab to be able to process data more quickly
- I use [Processing](https://processing.org/ "Processing") to make computer art with Java, which can be found on my [Pinterest page](https://www.instagram.com/sialjac/ "Pinterest page")
